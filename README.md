# MATS_9.0
This repo contains the code I used to analyze the behavior of late-MLP layers in suppressing correct token logit value.

My findings can be found at https://docs.google.com/document/d/105cLJmIxCIBv9DF_Ih3TLy7fiDpF1J_W1RkYZzkESuc/edit?usp=sharing

Special thanks to Gemini for helping with the bulk of the coding.
